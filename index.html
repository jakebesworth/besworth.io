                While working on my next RPG style game, I needed to implement audio in SDL2. The most recommended method is to use SDL_Mixer, but that library adds a ton of features I didn't need, and added more complexity to cross-platform compilability. While browsing the web, I didn't find many solutions, the closest thing to a <em>simple one file audio library</em> was this <a href="https://gist.github.com/armornick/3447121" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">gist</a>. This solution wasn't very generic, couldn't mix multiple audio sources, and used deprecated functions. This led me to spend time developing a simple, compatible, and modernized library solution.
                </p>
                <p>
                This library is simply just two files you include in your project, licensed under Apache2.0 License, and anyone is free to use it how they like if that falls under the terms of the license. There is a simple test.c file with an example of how to load music and sounds and how easy the library is to use. With SDL2 you can make any sort of desktop application from a video game to a media player to anything else, and my hope with the release of this code as FLOSS is that it allows others to benifit from the research I did in trying to implement native SDL2 audio.

                <img class="inline-img" height="811" width="1908" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakebesworth/uMinimal/master/img/example.png" alt="uMinimal Homepage">
                <p>
                uMinimal is a lightweight web application that displays videos in a clean way without use of any APIs. The web application is written in PHP, HTML5, CSS3, and native JavaScript and it leverages MySQL relational database management software as well as PHP-cURL, and PHP-MySQL.
                </p>
                <p>
                The purpose of this project was to fix my issues with JavaScript video players as a whole, and video user interfaces. To resolve these issues uMinimal only shows the videos you want, and has a dynamic JS video player which you can drag around, resize, maximize, or minimize.
                </p>
                <p>The way uMinimal works is that it builds a simple webpage (single-page site) by scraping webpages, such as youtube channels. All options are stored via cookies, not server-side, such as sort order, or watched videos (such that uMinimal won't display already watched videos if you request it.) Databasing happens in the <em>dynamic/datastore.php</em>, webpage scraping happens in <em>dynamic/scraper.php</em>. Main logic for building the webpage happens in <em>body.php</em>, and lastly the dynamic JavaScript player and related functions are stored in <em>minimal.js</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                The entire project is probably no more than 1500 lines of code, and is fairly efficient, making use of cURL multi interface for pseudo-threaded cURL requests. The parsing happens entirely through regex for a couple of reasons. I initially used the many PHP-DOM readers, parsers, and viewers, and they all sort of failed in a number of ways, such as when given imperfect HTML. The regex I wrote is theoretically O(n), whereas the parsers without their flaws would be O(1) which isn't that large of a gap for the small amount of logic uMinimal does each page load. The regex library is platform independant and doesn't require any extra installation. For comparison, the cURL requests take about 95% of runtime, so for optimization reasons the regex is not that much of a concern.

                This project is an implementation of the Continued Massive Network Game Object Server, which is an emulation software that has a long installation guide.

                </a>
                <p>
                The reason I started this project was because the default installation guide is incomplete, and doesn't really give a specific, copy paste implementation that I wanted. So the guide itself leverages an Amazon Web Services EC2 server instance running Ubuntu Server 14.04 and fixes all the holes in the default guide.

                The project is a simple desktop video game written in GNU C11 and Make, leveraging SDL2 media library. It compiles on GNU/Linux, Windows and OS X. The game itself is a top-down shooter, asteroids-like video game. I made this as an introduction to SDL2 for myself as I am now working on another, larger project.

                <p>
                I'm currently working towards a Bachelor of Computing with a major in Software Engineering (Co-op) at the University of Guelph, in Guelph Ontario Canada. I have a background in web development (more back-end than front-end) and system administration with platform-independant desktop applications as an area of interest.

                <p>
                I spend my free time hiking, running and doing my hobbies. Coding happens to be a hobby of mine since I created my first video game in GML when I was 13 so that happens to take up a lot of my time. I think my favourite thing to do is immersing myself into a great story.

                This entire website is hand written by me. I'm aware there are easier ways to build a website, but I think being able to write your own website from scratch shows some semblance of HTML5 and CSS3 knowledge. The site <em>works</em> on mobile, but is far from mobile friendly, something I'm aware of and working on.
