                While working on my next SDL2 RPG style game, I needed to implement audio. The most recommended method is to use SDL_Mixer, but that adds a ton of features I didn't need and added more complexity to cross-platform compilability. While browsing the web, I didn't find many solutions, the closest thing to a <em>simple one file audio library</em> was this <a href="https://gist.github.com/armornick/3447121" target="_blank">gist</a>. This solution was not very generic, couldn't mix multiple audio sources, and used deprecated functions. This led me to spending time developing a nice compatible, modern, light weight solution.
                </p>
                <p>
                This library is a simple two files, licensed under Apache2.0 License, and anyone is free to use it how they like if that falls under the terms of the license. There is a simple test.c file with an example of how to load music and sounds and how easy the library is to use. With SDL2 you can make any sort of desktop application from a video game to a media player to anything else, and my hope with the release of this code as FLOSS is that it allows others to benifit from the research I did in trying to implement native SDL2 audio.

                <p>
                uMinimal is a lightweight web application that displays youtube videos in a clean way without use of any APIs. The web application is written in PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and it leverages MySQL relational database management software as well as PHP-cURL, and PHP-MySQL.
                </p>
                <p>
                The purpose of this project was to fix my issues with JavaScript video players as a whole, and in this instance, youtube's interface. Youtube is bloated with recommended videos, a static video player, and the front page does not function perfectly. To resolve these issues uMinimal only shows the videos you want, and has a dynamic JS video player which you can drag around, resize, maximize, or minimize.
                </p>
                <p>The way uMinimal works is that it builds a simple webpage (single-page site) by scraping youtube channels. All options are stored via cookies, not server-side, such as sort order, or watched videos (such that uMinimal won't display already watched videos if you request it.) Databasing happens in the <em>dynamic/datastore.php</em>, webpage scraping happens in <em>dynamic/scraper.php</em>. Main logic for building the webpage happens in <em>body.php</em>, and lastly the dynamic JavaScript player and related functions are stored in <em>minimal.js</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                The entire project is probably no more than 1500 lines of code, and is fairly efficient, making use of cURL multi interface for pseudo-threaded cURL requests. The parsing happens entirely through regex for a couple of reasons. I initially used the many PHP-DOM readers, parsers, and viewers, and they all sort of failed in a number of ways, such as when given imperfect HTML. The regex I wrote is O(n) where the parsers without their flaws would be O(1) which isn't that large of a gap for the small amount of logic uMinimal does each page load. Also, the regex library is platform independant and doesn't require any extra installation. For comparison, the cURL requests take about 95% of runtime, so for optimization reasons the regex is not that much of a concern.
                </p>
                <p>
                The source code is not dependant on youtube, you can swap out the hardcoded URLs and regex to fit any video site, youtube was just used for proof of concept. uMinimal probably breaks ToS so it should not be used commercially.

                <p>
                The word Celestis is the name given to the project, which is a server implementation guide. Celestis is a fantasy city from Stargate, if you haven't watched Stargate, you definitely should, it's probably one of the more complex scifi shows next to Star Trek. This project is an implementation of the Continued Massive Network Game Object Server, which is an emulation software that has a long installation guide.

                </a>
                <p>
                The reason I started this project was because the default installation guide is incomplete, and doesn't really give a specific, copy paste implementation that I wanted. So the guide itself leverages an Amazon Web Services EC2 server instance and fixes all the holes in the default guide.

                The project is a simple desktop video game written in GNU C11 and Make, leveraging SDL2 media library. It compiles on GNU/Linux, Windows and OS X. The game itself is a top-down shooter, asteroids-like video game.
