                <p>
                This webpage is a reflection on my 2017 Winter work term at <a href="https://tulip.io/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Tulip Retail</a> as a Full Stack Web Developer.
                </p>
                <p>
                Included in my fourth work term report is an overview of life at Tulip, a description of my job, my goals, and what experiences I got out of it.

                <h1>Tulip - Workplace</h1>
                <p>
                Tulip Retail is located near the Toronto harbourfront, surrounded by awesome stores and places to see. Tulip is an absolutely friendly and amazing place to work, which you will hear from all the employees present and past. The company has a strong culture of inclusion and individuality, yet a strong sense of team, even family. As an Apple partner, the company specializes in a mobile platform, built exclusively for store associates, but also has ties in other areas, such as <a href="https://well.ca/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Well.ca</a>, a Canadian e-commerce retailer based in Guelph, that specializes in health and beauty supplies.
                </p>
                <p>
                Tulip offered me one of the most unique and inviting interview processes I have ever had. My manager Amir Habibi, and Diana Pavel left a really strong impression on me from how they conducted a thorough, yet extremely open interview that led us to discuss and joke about the costs of AWS, and the new features of PHP7, before delving into a game programming question about collision which I actually had on my Github.
                </p>
                <p>
                Tulip is a company that values it's employees, even from the first day I got there, they showered us with free food, weekly informative meetings, interesting activities, and birthday celebrations. The atmosphere lends to everyone helping each other out with problems and allowing cross-domain cooperation, to contrast, some companies it sometimes can be employees competing with each other to finish projects, at Tulip, it is the opposite. The CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aliasaria/?ppe=1" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Ali Asaria</a> explained it best, that Tulip works hard at keeping the culture they have, even if means taking their time in filling positions. Ali was a co-op and is a developer at heart, and a company run by tech-savvy people really shows when quality takes precedence in everything they do.

                <h1>Job Description</h1>
                <p>
                I was hired for the position of <em>Full-Stack Developer</em>, doing full stack PHP, MySQL, AWS development with a lot of system administration, and front-end design on Well.ca. You can (hopefully soon) see the full list on my <a href="/#about/resume">resume</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                I spent my time working on a myriad of Retail specific, and web development in general problems. A lot of time was spent implementing &amp; changing features, bug fixes, exploring Google Analytics / Tag Manager, optimizing queries and scripts, and much more. I gained a lot of experience working on theoretical work such as upgrading or moving to new technologies, such as laying out the plans and debating the benefits of different solutions. I also had to think more about scalable solutions, such that the large quantity of data, and number of users wouldn't affect the performance or seamless experience of the application. I spent a lot of time writing comprehensive, concise, yet easy to understand documentation for domain specific problems I encountered / solved, or guides for new co-ops to integrate seamlessly into their respective projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                With the sprints that we completed, I can comfortably say that my co-worker and myself made a positive impact at Tulip while we worked there. I even had the opportunity to move off of Well.ca and work Full-Stack on the main Tulip Application, and write comprehensive documents on some interesting features / problems I encountered.

        <div id="main-goals" style="display: none;">
            <div class="main-content">
                <h1>Work Term Goals</h1>
                <p>
                For my first goal, I aimed to improve my teamwork abilities outside my initial team, such as using Slack to communicate with other developers, and reaching out for help from other sources of information when I needed to. By the end of my term I can say I successfully participated in Slack at an alarming rate.
                </p>
                <p>
                My second goal is one of understanding the overlaying architecture and design of the Well.ca codebase. This is the project I was mostly focused on, and as a large complex problem, it can be hard to understand the entire structure of the code base. I intended to work through the work term mapping and understanding the entire architecture of the codebase for greater understanding and breadth of knowledge of it's design. By the end I had a much greater understanding of the many sub-projects inside Tulip, for which Well had much of it's structure.
                </p>
                <p>
                My final goal was one of written communication, and the ability to relay important information concisely, in a visually pleasing medium (usually markup or markdown), and with great detail. Being able to document code, features, interfaces, or other areas of development is crucial, and I think this is a goal I could work to improve throughout my semester. By the end of the term, I had many written "tickets" and documents in the company wiki, and felt I made my documentation accurate and easy to understand.

                <h1>What did I get out of my work term?</h1>
                <p>
                I gained a lot of new development experience and was able to explore, and even have a passion for all things Toronto this Winter. I built more on my foundation of web development knowledge, and got to make many great connections for which I am happy I had the opportunity to do so. Working at Tulip really shaped my idea of what a company can become from a startup.

                I wanted to thank Amir, Tony, Nikita, Heather, Yulin, Daniel, Peter, Brad, Trevor, Terry, Sahil, Elad, Kenny, Anca, Jory, Elizabeth, Will, Shawn, Gaelan, and pretty much everyone else at the company. Special shoutouts to Amir, my buddy, for supervising me over the last 4 months. I'd also like to thank Yulin for working with me directly as a part of the team, and putting up with my terrible jokes. I'd also like to thank my co-op coordinator and site visiter, Laura Gatto for the advice, help, and time she has put into my co-op term this Winter. Finally I'd like to thank Greg Klotz for all the time and effort he puts into reviewing my work term reports.
