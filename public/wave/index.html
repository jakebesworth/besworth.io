                This webpage is a reflection on my 2017 Winter work term at <a href="https://waveapps.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Wave</a> as a Software Engineer.
                </p>
                <p>
                Included in my fifth work term report is an overview of life at Wave, a description of my job, my goals, and what experiences I got out of it.

                <h1>Wave - Workplace</h1>
                <p>
                Wave is located in the east end of Toronto, in Leslieville, surrounded by an army of joggers, hip restaurants, and interesting things to do. Wave is a very friendly, yet focused place to work, I would say the definition of work hard, play hard. Some of the smartest, and most interesting people I've ever met work at Wave. <a href="https://waveapps.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Wave</a> is leader in modern, small business oriented financial software, such as accounting, bookkeeping, and invoicing, used by millions of small users.
                </p>
                <p>
                Wave offered me a completely unique and refreshing experience for my work term. The level of detail, knowledge, and dedication that goes into the development practices at Wave are incredible. At Wave, the developers and management care very deeply about security, modernity, performance, and best practices, and it was nice working with so many people who put in a lot of care and thought into even the smallest decisions.
                </p>
                <p>
                Probably my biggest take away by far from Wave were the people. Apart from being very interesting, every person I talked to at Wave offered me a unique perspective or experience, the openness of many was very shocking, even those not on my direct team were always willing to skip past small talk to something more meaningful.
                </p>
                <p>
                My first real day at Wave, my manager introduced me to the entire team. He even introduced me to a non-developer member as a "something engineer" studying machine learning. Little did I know at the time that he was sharing an inside joke, and he was not a developer at all... but that instant acceptance of me as "one of them" was something I didn't notice at the time. My team was very patient with my onboarding, and my having to learn an entirely new stack, showed praise when I did extraordinary work, and took me on many adventures in the short time I was there. The best way to describe my team would be "true friends".

            <div class="main-content">
                <h1>Job Description</h1>
                <p>
                I was hired for the position of <em>Software Engineer</em>, doing full stack Python/Django, React/Redux, Docker/Vagrant, Rails/Prawn, Angular, and a myriad of other technologies. While I had a lot of experience transitioning to new web development stacks, I hadn't worked much with Python, React or Ruby, so it was a perfect experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                I was on the accounting team working on their latest accounting features. I started off my time learning their really well architectured Django backend. I later worked on their React frontend and delved into Django templates, and Angular for a few tickets. A little over half way through the term I was put onto more unique (less standard) problems, one being analytics, doing some frontend additions for that. Nearing the end of my term, I was put on a Rails project, and spent a large portion rewriting it from scratch with a new architecture matching the Django side, adding test cases, documentation, coding style standards, scalability, and new output style.
                </p>
                <p>
                With the many projects I completed, I can can say that I made a really positive impact at Wave. I solved a lot of interesting problems that I had to think a lot about, rather than just mindlessly solving them. If you use Wave, and do accounting, you may see the many small, and large features I worked on!
                </p>

        <div id="main-goals" style="display: none;">
            <div class="main-content">
                <h1>Work Term Goals</h1>
                <p>
                My first goal was one to improve how I go about problem solving, such as the techniques for implementing solutions in a faster and more reliable way. An example of such might be: improving my test-driven-development abilities, or other such methods. I learned the opposite, and spent more time thinking about a more... macro view of the problem, rather than rushing to solve it with the first few solutions I had access to. This technique led to less refactoring, and quicker deploying.
                </p>
                <p>
                There was a lot of documentation and communication that happened at Wave. For my second goal I wanted to improve my written communication, such as improving my commit messages, pull requests, general documentation, and use of communication software. I made it my mission to add more documentation in areas I was working on, and for the final project I left behind, I updated all the documentation, and even gave a small talk on it and answered questions.
                </p>
                <p>
                Wave had a lot of new technologies and information to absorb, specifically Python and React development. For my last goal I wanted to improve my depth and breadth of understanding of the stacks and technologies they use, and try to learn a lot more about my domain (accounting). I learned a lot more about finances, specifically accounting, and learned a few new stacks that I will hopefully use much more in the future.

                <h1>What did I get out of my work term?</h1>
                <p>
                The three most important things I learned about in my brief foray in East Toronto were life as a bachelor, modern software development in a focused startup, and true friendship.

                I wanted to thank Alex, Joseph, Jennifer, Can, Tommy, Marcelo, Frederic, Fred, Peter, Justin, Ghaz, Jason, Kenny, Yash, Pat, and everyone else at the company. I'd also like to thank my co-op coordinator and site visiter, Laura Gatto for the advice, help, and time she has put into entire co-op career. Finally I'd like to thank Greg Klotz for all the time and effort he puts into reviewing my work term reports x5.

                <p>
                I guess this is the end of... something. Even though my shoes were too tight, I'm happy I got to dance. Thanks for reading.
