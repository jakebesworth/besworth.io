                <p>
                This webpage is a reflection on my 2016 Summer work term at <a href="https://symcor.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Symcor</a> as a Full Stack Web Developer.
                </p>
                <p>
                Included in my third work term report is an overview of life at Symcor, a description of my job, my goals, and what I got out of it.
                </p>
                <p>
                My goal with this webpage is to show you what I learned in my summer of 2016, as well as an accurate picture of my daily life at Symcor.

                <h1>Symcor - Workplace</h1>
                <p>
                Symcor does a lot of <a href="https://symcor.com/en/what-we-can-do-for-you" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">things</a>, but my job consisted of working in the Enterprise Architecture team, on an application used to survey the employees at Symcor. I worked on a team directly under Jack Vanderhorst, also under Ivan Welsh, and worked equally with another co-op student from Guelph, <a href="http://anandpatel.me" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Anand Patel</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                Symcor is a really cool place located in Mississauga near Square One. They have a floor with pool, foosball, T.V.s, an icecream machine, a popcorn machine and more. The company at least where I worked is very technology oriented, and the developers and managers are always tech talking. Square One also offers tons of great food locations and places to go, which is but a 5 minute walk from the front door of the building.
                </p>
                <p>
                Symcor has many meetings, events, and gatherings, all being extremely interesting such as hearing talks from the CEO, or CTO, to having a <em>cowboy themed barbecue</em> with way too much food for me to handle, which was hosted for Symcor. Overall life at Symcor is fun and interesting, experienced, and stable, and I thoroughly enjoyed my summer working there.

                <h1>Job Description</h1>
                <p>
                I was hired for the position of <em>Web Developer</em>, doing full stack Java development with a bit of system administration, and front-end design sprinkled in there. You can see the full list on my <a href="/#about/resume">resume</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                I spent a lot of time implementing &amp; changing features, or doing bug fixes for our web application. I implemented automation, reporting, new designs, performance and security audits, and many new forms and views on the front-end. I gained a lot of experience working with production ready Java which I had not had experience working with before. I also had to think more about scalable solutions, such that the large quantity of data and number of users wouldn't affect the performance or seamless experience of the application.
                </p>
                <p>
                With the sprints that we completed, I can comfortably say that my co-worker and myself made a positive impact at Symcor while we worked there. We managed to do two production deployments to finish up all of the application functionality that was required for completion and more.

                <h1>Work Term Goals</h1>
                <p>
                My first work term goal was my ability to assess, manage, and solve problems at an even higher level than when I started. This is a constant goal of mine, which I have been building on since I started co-op well over a year ago. Due to the myriad of new technologies, this goal was one I saw progress throughout my work term, and saw a very impactful change nearing the end of my work term.
                </p>
                <p>
                My next work term goal was to work on my teamwork abilities due to the fact I was working with another developer directly. I spent the work term improving my communication, and interpersonal skills. My supervisor mentioned he was very impressed with my ability to work in a team, and even lead, and I felt very confident after the months past about my ability to work with one of more developers specifically on a single project.
                </p>
                <p>
                I wanted to work on my ability to understand and use many new and unfamiliar technologies and standards. I was put straight into the fire of Java development and it added great experience to my overall ability to quickly familiarize myself with new technologies. After my work term, my overall web development knowledge was much stronger than previously, and I now have a much better understanding of full stack Java web development.
                </p>
                <p>
                The final goal I gave myself was one most developers seem to understand, which is time management in terms of estimating goals and executing within a time frame. I found myself very able to predict how long tasks would take and what to give as solid estimates throughout my work term, which was my original goal.
                </p>

                <h1>What did I get out of my work term?</h1>
                <p>
                I gained a lot of new development experience and was able to explore and experience Square One, Mississauga over my work term this Summer. I built more on my foundation of web development knowledge, and got to make many great connections for which I am happy I had the opportunity to do so.
                </p>
                <p>
                I wanted to thank Jack Vanderhorst and Ivan Welsh for hiring me and supervising me over the last 4 months. I'd also like to thank Anand Patel for working with me directly as a part of the team. I'd also like to thank my co-op coordinator and site visiter, Laura Gatto for all the advice, help, and time she has put into my co-op career so far. Finally I'd like to thank Greg Klotz for all the time and effort he puts into reviewing my work term reports, and this one in particular.
