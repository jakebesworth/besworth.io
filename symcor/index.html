                <p>
                This webpage is a reflection on my 2016 Summer work term at <a href="https://symcor.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Symcor</a> as a Full Stack Web Developer.
                </p>
                <p>
                Included in my third work term report is an overview of life at Symcor, a description of my job, my goals, and what I got out of it.

                <h1>Symcor - Workplace</h1>
                <p>
                Symcor does a lot of <a href="https://symcor.com/en/what-we-can-do-for-you" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">things</a>, but my job consisted of working in the Enterprise Architecture team, on an application used to survey the employees at Symcor. I worked on a team directly under Jack Vanderhorst, also under Ivan Welsh, and worked equally with another co-op student from Guelph, <a href="http://anandpatel.me" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Anand Patel</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                Symcor is a really cool place located in Mississauga near Square One. They have a floor with pool, foosball, T.V.s, an icecream machine, a popcorn machine and more. The company at least where I worked is very technology oriented, and the developers and managers are always tech talking. Square One also offers tons of great food locations and places to go, which is but a 5 minute walk from the front door of the building.
                </p>
                Symcor has many meetings, events, and gatherings, all being extremely interesting such as hearing talks from the CEO, or CTO, to having a <em>cowboy themed barbecue</em> with way too much food for me to handle, which was hosted for Symcor. Overall life at Symcor is fun and interesting, experienced, and stable, and I thoroughly enjoyed my summer working there.

                <h1>Job Description</h1>
                <p>
                I was hired for the position of <em>Web Developer</em> with a Full Java Stack with a bit of system administration sprinkled in there. You can see the full list on my <a href="/#about/resume">resume</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                I spent a lot of time implementing or changing features for our web application such as automation, reporting on the back-end or design, performance, and forms on the front-end. I gained a lot of experience working with production ready Java which I had not had experience working with before.
                </p>
                <p>
                With the sprints that we completed, I can comfortably say that my co-worker and myself made a positive impact at Symcor while we worked there.

                <h1>Work Term Goals</h1>
                <p>
                My first work term goal was my ability to assess, manage, and solve problems at a high level. Due to the myriad of new technologies, this goal was one I saw progress throughout my work term.
                </p>
                <p>
                My next work term goal was to work on my teamwork abilities due to the fact I was working with another developer directly. I spent the work term improving my communication, and interpersonal skills.
                </p>
                <p>
                I wanted to work on my ability to understand and use many new and unfamiliar technologies and standards. I was put straight into the fire of Java developmentand it added great experience to my overall ability to quickly familiarize myself with new technologies.
                </p>
                <p>
                The final goal I gave myself was one most developers seem to understand, which is time management in terms of estimating goals and executing within a time frame. I found myself very able to predict how long tasks would take and what to give as solid estimates throughout my work term, which was my original goal.
                </p>

                <h1>What did I get out of my work term?</h1>
                <p>
                I gained a lot of new development experience and was able to explore and experience Square One, Mississauga over my work term this Summer.
                </p>
                <p>
                I wanted to thank Jack Vanderhorst and Ivan Welsh for hiring me and supervising me over the last 4 months. I'd also like to thank Anand Patel for working with me on the application.
